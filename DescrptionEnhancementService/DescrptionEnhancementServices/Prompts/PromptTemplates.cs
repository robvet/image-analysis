        // Encourage Conciseness: Instruct the LLM to respond concisely.The JSON format naturally keeps responses short.
        // Prompt Reinforcement: Emphasize the JSON format and fields (object and probability) to guide the model to follow the structure exactly.
        // Temperature and Top-p: Set temperature to a low value(e.g., 0.1) and top-p between 0.1 and 0.3 to minimize creative variance,
        // which is important when you need consistent JSON outputs and a straightforward probability estimate.
